# Genetic-Disorder-Prediction
Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aibuzz/predict-the-genetic-disorders-datasetof-genomes

Genetic-Disorder-Prediction uses a dataset of medical history such as blood cell count, heart rate, symptoms, and parental genetic information in order to predict the genetic disorder and disorder subclass. After cleaning and exploring the data, I ran different models with grid search cross validation in order to find the best model. I ended on a MLP model and a Naive Bayes model and achieved an averaged f1 score of .408, compared to a score achieved with random guessing of .198. Then, I decide to explore pytorch neural nets more and was able to achieve an average f1 score of 0.425 using one for each of my target variables. I'm now working on creating a more advanced pytorch neural network model.
